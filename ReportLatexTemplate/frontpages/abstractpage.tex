Each year about 19,000 people in the United States are diagnosed with primary brain cancers. The risk of developing brain cancer increases with age. Cancers of the brain are the consequence of abnormal growths of cells in the brain.  The increased use of CT (Computed Tomography), correlates with the increased incidence trends, and represents a greater tendency of physicians to aggressively pursue brain diagnoses in older patients. CT has become a commonly performed procedure which is a noninvasive, safe, and well-tolerated one. The brain CT examines the various structures of the brain to look for a mass, stroke, area of bleeding, or blood vessel abnormality. It provides a highly detailed look at many different parts of the body.  We develop a novel Computer Aided Diagnosis(CAD) system for tumour detection and classification in brain image based on the Fuzzy Support Vector Machine. The system follows the basic steps of CAD system such as preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction and selection and classification. The classified results are then evaluated using five measurements such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value. The system thus developed will be an effective and accurate approach in the diagnosis of Brain Tumour.
